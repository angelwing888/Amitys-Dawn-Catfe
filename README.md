**5 Points) List of contributions of each member of the group**

I am the only person working on this game, including the map design, script writing, and object configurations. The assets such as tilemaps, music, and sprites are linked at the bottom, along with the video tutorials I used. Claude AI was used to help me update some scripts to be more current in the scenarios of compatability issues and for debugging the barista interface and npc mechanics. 

**(5 Points) Brief video demonstration of 80% completed game**

note: turn up your volume! i had to download a 3rd party software to screen record with audio on Mac and it made the audio really quiet.

**(10 Points) One completed "stage" or "level"**

The video contains one completed stage of the game. You can see me interacting with the customers, accepting the orders, brewing the coffee, and then taking it back to the customer. The time limit was set at 3 minutes to account for any time lost through the demo. When the timer hits 0, the game is over. In a situation that isn't the demo, the time limit would've been around 2 minutes for further time pressure. The goal is to get the highest score possible, which is 180 (what was seen in the video). If orders are not fulfilled, the score is deducted by 30 points per customer at the end. Meanwhile, there are also bonus points through putting the empty cups into the sink, so players will need to manage their time wisely to get all the possible points. 

These are the tutorials and assets I used to help create my game:
