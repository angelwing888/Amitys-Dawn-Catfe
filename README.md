# Amitys-Dawn-Catfe

**Checkpoint 3: Game test summary**

Unimplemented at time of testing: 

- Sink interaction (to place empty cups for points)

- Failed drink dialogue

- Drink spawning on table after handing in

- Petting the cat
 
Issues noted:

- Making drinks first and interacting with cat after taking order immediately turns it in, setting dialogue to completed index before necessary

- UI issue with inventory - slot background disappears after swapping items around

- Collision hitbox issues

- Interaction icon - change to something else or give another indicator of what player can interact with

- Sorting issue with barista interface and main menu interface (fixed)

  
**Game Tester 1 - Brandon**
1. What is one thing you enjoyed about the game?

I enjoyed the aesthetic and cozy atmosphere. The cats talking are really endearing and adorable.
 
2. What is one thing that could be improved or changed?

The menu with the coffee drinks could be implemented within the café itself instead of the main menu. And maybe a small animation for the coffee brewing?
 
3. Were there any glaring issues you found while playing? This includes movement, overall fluidity, ease of use, etc.  

Maybe the interaction points could be a bit more accessible and obvious instead of just an exclamation point.
 
4. Is there anything missing that you wish was in the game?

A coffee brewing animation.
 
5. Currently, pending orders are displayed in the main menu/pause menu. Would you rather have it in a separate button where you can continue moving your character while it’s open (at the cost of the timer not pausing while it’s open)? Or do you want it to stay as is?

A separate button or an interactable board in the game itself would be great.
 

**Game Tester 2 - Emily**

1. What is one thing you enjoyed about the game?
   
I enjoyed the café music and cozy vibes.
 
3. What is one thing that could be improved or changed?

The interaction functionality could be more consistent with the other game mechanics, such as allowing menu navigation and dialogue selection via keyboard
 
4. Were there any glaring issues you found while playing? This includes movement, overall fluidity, ease of use, etc. 

When in barista mode, the menu screen can be activated but shows up underneath the barista screen, not on top.
 
5. Is there anything missing that you wish was in the game?

A brewing and/or time delay to add a sense of urgency to completing the tasks.
 
6. Currently, pending orders are displayed in the main menu/pause menu. Would you rather have it in a separate button where you can continue moving your character while it’s open (at the cost of the timer not pausing while it’s open)? Or do you want it to stay as is?

I would like it to be in a separate button or even a small window/notepad that persists on screen at all times when there is an order placed.

 
**Game Tester 3 - Cyrene**

1. What is one thing you enjoyed about the game?

I like cats

3. What is one thing that could be improved or changed?

More dialogue or things to give the cats

4. Were there any glaring issues you found while playing? This includes movement, overall fluidity, ease of use, etc. 

Collision hitboxes were a little weird and I had to keep going back and forth to the coffee machine since it forces me to walk away

5. Is there anything missing that you wish was in the game?

Pastries/Food

6. Currently, pending orders are displayed in the main menu/pause menu. Would you rather have it in a separate button where you can continue moving your character while it’s open (at the cost of the timer not pausing while it’s open)? Or do you want it to stay as is?

Separate button so that I can see the orders easier
 

**Game Test Summary**

Everyone seemed to enjoy the game’s aesthetics and coziness, especially with the cafe theme, music, and cats. The main critiques were regarding how the pending orders and menu/recipes were embedded in the main menu. Instead, they wanted it outside in a different button or interactable object. I thought about this while making the questions, so I added question 5 asking if they’d want the orders to be in a separate button and interface, and all of them said yes. Game fluidity could be improved through movement and interaction popups. Other new things I could add are more things to turn in (ex. pastries) and more time pressure elements, such as brewing times.

Interaction improvements: Better indicators than exclamation points, more consistent keyboard controls, easier-to-access interaction points

**Technical issues:**

- Collision hitbox problems (player forced away from coffee machine)
