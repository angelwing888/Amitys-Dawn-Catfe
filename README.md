(10 points) Game synopsis, objective, and brief description of mechanics

Amity's Dawn Catfé is a café simulator where the player recieves cat customers and takes their order. The main game is structured under a timed level system, while there's another infinite leisure mode where the player can serve drinks for as long as they want. Following instructions on screen, they must make different coffee drinks in the correct order and proportions of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam, along with syrups for flavoring. Then, the player must navigate through the cafe to take the order to the customer, who will give a score based on how well the player did. A sufficient score will allow the player to progress to the next level, unlocking new drinks along the way. If any cats are left in the cafe, when the timer is up, points will be lost. Additional points can be gained by cleaning tables and getting drinks to customers quickly. Progress through the levels, upgrade the cafe, and appease the furry customers!

note: this layout and café name comes from Amity's Dawn in Final Fantasy XIV! It's an in-game café I co-own with my partner, and I got permission from her to use her design for the café as inspiration for this project. All concept design images are screenshots taken from the café to use as references for this game's design.
