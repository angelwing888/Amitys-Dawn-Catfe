(10 points) Game synopsis, objective, and brief description of mechanics

Synopsis:

Amity's Dawn Catfé is a café simulator where the player recieves cat customers and takes their order. Progress through timed levels and upgrade the café or relax with an infinite leisure mode where the player can serve drinks for as long as they want. Players can make and serve drinks to the cats before the time is up, and unlock new drinks as the game continues. As the player progresses, more customers will come while demanding more complex drinks. Become the greatest barista known to cats, and maybe they'll allow pets in return! 

Objective:

The objective of the game is to correctly make the orders of all customers before the timer ends and recieve enough points to progress to the next level. 

Description of Mechanics: 

The player will have to interact with new customers to add their order to the list. They must return behind the counter and interact with the coffee machine to bring up the barista menu, which has instructions to create each drink. Following instructions, they must select different options in the correct order and proportions of espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam, along with syrups for flavoring. Then, the player must move through the cafe and remember which drink belongs to which customer. If the drink is made correctly and is brought to the right customer, the player gets full points. If the player was successful within a short amount of time, the player can pet the cat and recieve extra points. If the player brought the drink to the right cat but the drink is incorrect, they get half points. If it's the wrong cat, they get no points. Additional tasks like collecting cups will add to the overall score. If any cats are left in the cafe, when the timer is up, points will be lost. Upon reaching the required point threshold, the player can proceed to the next level. Upgrading the cafe in later levels will add tools to speed along the process.

note: this layout and café name comes from Amity's Dawn in Final Fantasy XIV! It's an in-game café I co-own with my partner, and I got permission from her to use her design for the café as inspiration for this project. All concept design images are screenshots taken from the café to use as references for this game's design.
