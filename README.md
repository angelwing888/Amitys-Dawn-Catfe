# Amitys-Dawn-Catfe

**Summary**

It's the grand opening for your new coffee shop, and after hours of preparation, you open your doors, to find... cats?? Play Amity's Dawn Catfé, where you can serve catpuccinos and meowcchiatos to little furry companions! Take their orders, make their drinks, and give them a purrfect experience at your cafe! Use your time wisely and gain as many points as possible within the time limit. Be careful not to mess up their drinks, or they won't be happy and points will be deducted. And yes, you can pet the cats! 

**Brief video demonstration of game**

note: turn up your volume! i had to download a 3rd party software to screen record with audio on Mac and it made the audio really quiet.

The video contains one completed stage of the game. You can see me interacting with the customers, accepting the orders, brewing the coffee, and then taking it back to the customer. The time limit was set at 3 minutes to account for any time lost through the demo. When the timer hits 0, the game is over. In a situation that isn't the demo, the time limit would've been around 2 minutes for further time pressure. The goal is to get the highest score possible, which is 180 (what was seen in the video). If orders are not fulfilled, the score is deducted by 30 points per customer at the end. Meanwhile, there are also bonus points through putting the empty cups into the sink, so players will need to manage their time wisely to get all the possible points. 

**Future implementations**
